# 1. Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.


num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# ->> Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

# After run the code you just need to input any number (positive, negative, or zero)
# Example: 30, -17, 0, 100...! and so on.
